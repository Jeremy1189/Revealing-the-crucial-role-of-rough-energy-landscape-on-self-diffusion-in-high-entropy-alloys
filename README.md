# Revealing-the-crucial-role-of-rough-energy-landscape-on-self-diffusion-in-high-entropy-alloys
This code is to show how the machine learning method is used to combinning the kMC in the paper "Revealing-the-crucial-role-of-rough-energy-landscape-on-self-diffusion-in-high-entropy-alloys"
A CST method was firstly used to combining the ML model with the kMC, which make the ML model can predict the on-the-fly barrier energies with almost the same accuracy as the static model for the dynamic kMC modleling.
